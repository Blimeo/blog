    <p>MIT Prophet is first trained on a set of successful human patches. It uses a log-linear probabilistic model find the maximum probability of observing the traning set in the model. It also extracts information about how the patch modifies the error and what variables the patch accesses. 
    </p>
    <p>
    After training, Prophet is applied to a defective program. It first locates the defect by noticing which statements in code are executed more frequently in the negative test cases. Then it uses an SPR search space to generate possible patches for different likely locations, then ranks the patches according to the probability of correctness. 
    </p>
    <p>
    This probability is calculated by computing a feature vector for each candidate patch and then applying the model learned from the training set to the feature vector using this equation:<p>
    $$
    P(m, l | p, \theta) = 1/Z * A * B
    $$
    <p>\(m\) and \(l\) describe respectively the modification that the patch would contain and the location of the patch \(\delta\), \(p\) is the program, and \(\theta\) is the model vector that Prophet learns in the offline learning step. A and B are described by the following equations:</p>
    $$
    A = (1 - \beta)^{r(p, l)}
    $$
    $$
    B = \frac{ exp( \phi(p, m, l) * \theta)}{\Sigma _{l' \in L(p)} \Sigma _{m' \in M(p,l')} exp( \phi(p, m', l') * \theta)}
    $$
    <p>
    \(A\) is a geometric distribution describing the identified locations that the patch should attempt to fix. \(B\) is a log-linear distribution determined by the extracted feature vectors \(\phi\) and the learned parameter vector \(\theta\).</p>
    <p>The denominator of \(B\) is the value computed by the numerator expressed for every location that can be modified and every modification that can be made.</p>
