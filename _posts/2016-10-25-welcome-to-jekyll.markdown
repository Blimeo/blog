Daniel and Shannon, this is a placeholder post.

We're rolling w Jekyll for the blog cuz I don't have time to build css for this Tuesday night deadline.

Code snippet example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Markdown math possibilities:

-maybe R-studio
-Mathjax
-latex pdf embed
